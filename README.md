# Employee-Management-System

# Note Taker App

## The Project

For this project I've created a team profile manager to assist in employee management for small businesses using databases!

## Usage

Simply follow the command line prompts to update and store new information in your database! Feel free to update tables, roles, salaries- all at your convenience through the prompts given!
